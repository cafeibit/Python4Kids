    "### 8. Python Function\n",
    "> A function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. (A statement is a unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a value. When you type a statement, the interpreter executes it, which means that it does\n",
    "whatever the statement says.) When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can “call” the function by name.If you need to perform that task multiple times throughout your program, you don’t need to type all the code for the same task again and again; you just call the function dedicated to handling that task, and the call tells Python to run the code inside the function. You’ll find that using functions makes your programs easier to write, read, test, and fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Defining a Function</b>\n",
    "> Uses the keyword <code>def</code> to inform Python that you’re defining a function. This is the function definition, which tells Python the name of the function and, if applicable, what kind of information the function needs to do its job. The parentheses hold that information. In this case, the name of the function is greet_user(), and it needs no information to do its job, so its parentheses are empty. (Even so, the parentheses are required.) Finally, the definition ends in a colon. Any indented lines that follow def greet_user(): make up the body of the function. The text at v is a comment called a docstring, which describes\n",
    "what the function does. Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes, which Python looks for when it generates documentation for the functions in your programs. Here’s a simple function named greet_user() that prints a greeting:\n",

To call a function, you write the name of the function, followed by any necessary information in parentheses, as shown at x. Because no information is needed here, calling our function is as simple as entering greet_user(). As expected, it prints Hello!\n",
    "\n",
    "函数代码块以 def 关键词开头，后接函数标识符名称和圆括号，在圆括号里是传进来的参数，然后通过 return 进行函数结果得反馈。需要注意的是，Python 不像其他语言一样使用{}或者 begin…end 来分隔代码块，而是采用代码缩进和冒号的方式来区分代码之间的层次关系。所以代码缩进在 Python 中是一种语法，如果代码缩进不统一，比如有的是 tab 有的是空格，会怎样呢？会产生错误或者异常。相同层次的代码一定要采用相同层次的缩进。"

    "<b>Passing an Arbitrary Number of Arguments</b>\n",
    "> Sometimes you won’t know ahead of time how many arguments a function needs to accept. Fortunately, Python allows a function to collect an arbitrary number of arguments from the calling statement. For example, consider a function that builds a pizza. It needs to accept a number of toppings, but you can’t know ahead of time how many toppings a person will want. The function in the following example has one parameter, *toppings, but this parameter collects as many arguments as the calling line provides:\n",

    "</code>\n",
    "> The asterisk in the parameter name *toppings tells Python to make an empty tuple called toppings and pack whatever values it receives into this tuple. The print() call in the function body produces output showing that Python can handle a function call with one value and a call with three values. It treats the different calls similarly. Note that Python packs the arguments into a tuple, even if the function receives only one value. This syntax works no matter how many arguments the function\n",

    "#### Storing Your Functions in Modules\n",
    "> One advantage of functions is the way they separate blocks of code from your main program. By using descriptive names for your functions, your main program will be much easier to follow. You can go a step further by storing your functions in a separate file called a module and then importing that module into your main program. An import statement tells Python to make the code in a module available in the currently running program file. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Storing your functions in a separate file allows you to hide the details of your program’s code and focus on its higher-level logic. It also allows you to reuse functions in many different programs. When you store your functions in separate files, you can share those files with other programmers without having to share your entire program. Knowing how to import functions\n",
    "also allows you to use libraries of functions that other programmers have written. There are several ways to import a module, and I’ll show you each of these briefly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Importing an Entire Module</b>\n",
    "> To start importing functions, we first need to create a module. A module is a file ending in .py that contains the code you want to import into your program. Let’s make a module that contains the function make_pizza(). To make this module, we’ll remove everything from the file pizza.py except the function make_pizza(): pizza.py \n",
    "<code>\n",
    "def make_pizza(size, *toppings):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Summarize the pizza we are about to make.\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(f\"\\nMaking a {size}-inch pizza with the following toppings:\")\n",
    "    for topping in toppings:\n",
    "        print(f\"- {topping}\")</code>\n",
    "    \n",
    "> Now we’ll make a separate file called making_pizzas.py in the same directory as pizza.py. This file imports the module we just created and then makes two calls to make_pizza():\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "import pizza\n",
    "\n",
    "pizza.make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')\n",
    "pizza.make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "> This first approach to importing, in which you simply write import followed by the name of the module, makes every function from the module available in your program. If you use this kind of import statement to import an entire module named module_name.py, each function in the module is available through the following syntax: \n",
    "<b>module_name.function_name()<b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Importing Specific Functions</b>\n",
    "> You can also import a specific function from a module. Here’s the general syntax for this approach:\n",
    "<b>from module_name import function_name</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can import as many functions as you want from a module by separating each function’s name with a comma:\n",
    "<b>from module_name import function_0, function_1, function_2</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "> The making_pizzas.py example would look like this if we want to import just the function we’re going to use:\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "from pizza import make_pizza\n",
    "make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')\n",
    "make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "> With this syntax, you don’t need to use the dot notation when you call a function. Because we’ve explicitly imported the function make_pizza() in the import statement, we can call it by name when we use the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Using as to Give a Function an Alias</b>\n",
    "> If the name of a function you’re importing might conflict with an existing name in your program or if the function name is long, you can use a short, unique alias—an alternate name similar to a nickname for the function. You’ll give the function this special nickname when you import the function. Here we give the function make_pizza() an alias, mp(), by importing make_pizza as mp. The as keyword renames a function using the alias you provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "from pizza import make_pizza as mp\n",
    "    \n",
    "mp(16, 'pepperoni')\n",
    "mp(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "> The import statement shown here renames the function make_pizza() to mp() in this program. Any time we want to call make_pizza() we can simply write mp() instead, and Python will run the code in make_pizza() while avoiding any confusion with another make_pizza() function you might have written in this program file.The general syntax for providing an alias is:\n",
    "<b>from module_name import function_name as fn</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Using as to Give a Module an Alias</b>\n",
    "> You can also provide an alias for a module name. Giving a module a short alias, like p for pizza, allows you to call the module’s functions more quickly. Calling p.make_pizza() is more concise than calling pizza.make_pizza():\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "import pizza as p\n",
    "p.make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')\n",
    "p.make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "> The general syntax for this approach is:<b>import module_name as mn<b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>Importing All Functions in a Module</b>\n",
    "> You can tell Python to import every function in a module by using the asterisk (*) operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "from pizza import *\n",
    "make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')\n",
    "make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "> The asterisk in the import statement tells Python to copy every function from the module pizza into this program file. Because every function is imported, you can call each function by name without using the dot notation. However, it’s best not to use this approach when you’re working with larger modules that you didn’t write: if the module has a function name that matches an existing name in your project, you can get some unexpected results. Python may see several functions or variables with the\n",
    "same name, and instead of importing all the functions separately, it will overwrite the functions. The best approach is to import the function or functions you want, or import the entire module and use the dot notation. This leads to clear code that’s easy to read and understand. I include this section so you’ll recognize import statements like the following when you see them in other people’s code:<b>from module_name import *</b>"

    "#### Styling Functions\n",
    "> You need to keep a few details in mind when you’re styling functions. Functions should have descriptive names, and these names should use lowercase letters and underscores. Descriptive names help you and others understand what your code is trying to do. Module names should use these conventions as well. Every function should have a comment that explains concisely what the function does. This comment should appear immediately after the function definition and use the docstring format. In a well-documented function, other programmers can use the function by reading only the description in the docstring. They should be able to trust that the code works as described, and as long as they know the name of the function, the arguments it needs, and the kind of value it returns, they should be able to use it in their programs. If you specify a default value for a parameter, no spaces should be used on either side of the equal sign:\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "def function_name(parameter_0, parameter_1='default value')</code>\n",
    "The same convention should be used for keyword arguments in function calls:\n",
    "function_name(value_0, parameter_1='value')\n",
    "PEP 8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) recommends that you limit lines of code to 79 characters so every line is visible in a reasonably sized editor window. If a set of parameters causes a function’s definition to be longer than 79 characters, press enter after the opening parenthesis on the definition line. On the next line, press tab twice to separate the list of arguments from the body of the function, which will only be indented one level. Most editors automatically line up any additional lines of parameters to match the indentation you have established on the first line:\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "def function_name(\n",
    " parameter_0, parameter_1, parameter_2,\n",
    " parameter_3, parameter_4, parameter_5):\n",
    " function body...</code>\n",
    "\n",
    ">If your program or module has more than one function, you can separate each by two blank lines to make it easier to see where one function ends and the next one begins. All import statements should be written at the beginning of a file. The only exception is if you use comments at the beginning of your file to describe the overall program."
